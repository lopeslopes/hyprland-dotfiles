# hyprland-dotfiles
Dotfiles for sway (and now hyprland as a backup) desktop configuration

My hyprland broke so I swapped to sway for the stability. Also started experimenting with eww instead of waybar.

- sway (WM)
- eww (status bar and widgets)
- wofi (dmenu/power menu)
- grim + slurp (screenshot)
- waypaper (wallpaper)
- swaylock (screen lock)
- pcmanfm-qt (file explorer)
- sakura (terminal)
- pavucontrol, pactl (sound stuff)

I also added my neovim configuration folder to have it all in one place.

To do:
- Clean volume control scripts
- Figure out corner that doesn't round in action center
- Rewrite network and bluetooth buttons in action center
- Maybe check why notifications weren't working before I commented the section out
- Clean music detection script
- Add a system tray to the bar
