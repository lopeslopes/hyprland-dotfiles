Dotfiles for Hyprland desktop configuration

This configuration uses the Hyprland WM in conjunction with Waybar (for status bar and system tray) and Wofi (for dmenu and power menu).

Some packages you'll need to replicate this are:
- Hyprland (WM)
- Waybar (status bar)
- Wofi (dmenu/power menu)
- Grim + Slurp (screenshot utils)
- Hyprpaper (wallpaper)
- Swaylock (screen lock)

I also added my neovim configuration folder, that was made following the neovim guide by ThePrimeagen on youtube.

To do:
- Create css file with standardized colors for all applications, to make it easier to setup a theme.
